        <h1 class="title">Bootstrap</h1>
        <span class="border border-info border-2">
          <h5 class="title">Bootstrap is a web development toolkit that utilizes Javascript to optimize a website.</h5>
        </span>
        <br>
        <p>Bootstrap has many capabilities to make a website more optimal, including the Navigation menu at the top and the dark mode of the website! Another big thing that it
          adds is universal browser accessability. Viewing websites across devices with different resolutions can be tricky and unoptimized for navigation, which is why Bootstrap
          has an ability to adjust the width of the website based upon the devices width. That way, you won't have to deal with awkwardly cropped sites again. There are a lot of other
          features that could be expanded upon that I may not have had a need to use for this example, so if you'd like to see what this is truly capable of, visit <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">
            Bootstrap's Website</a> for more details.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Here are some examples of features I find interesting, other than the ones that are already implemented on the site.</p>

        <h6>  Color picker</h6>

        <div class="spinner-border text-info" role="status">
          <span class="visually-hidden">Loading...</span>
